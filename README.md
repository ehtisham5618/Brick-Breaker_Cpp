- Bricks that break on impact with the ball
- Real-time movement and keyboard controls
- Score tracking and game-over conditions
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Power-ups like multi-ball and paddle extension
- Adjustable ball angles and speed mechanics
- High score saving mechanism

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project was developed during the **Programming Fundamentals** course but with an early introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation of game entities like Paddle, Ball, and Brick
- Inheritance (if applicable in your version)
- Console handling using basic Linux terminal logic
- Creative collision detection and manual physics implementation
